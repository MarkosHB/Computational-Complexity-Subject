# Computational-Complexity-Subject
Feel free to have a look at those presentations of your interest!
- Check out a cool [PresentacionMT.pdf](./TuringMachine/) about a Turing Machine Unitape and its equivalent Multitape version (made fully by me).
- In [Slides UNARY-SSUM.pdf](./UNARY-SSUM/) u will find a demostration (a few actually) of how large inputs can mess up complexity...
